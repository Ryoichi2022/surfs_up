## 3. Summary
### Summary of analysis
The following are the high-level summaries of the analysis:

* Mild temperature - In the island of Oahu, the temperature seems mild throughout the year, as it is generally considered, based on the average temperatures in June and December. The difference in these temperatures is approximately 4 F. The island will offer a favorable environment for the surf and ice cream shop.

* Change in temperature - On the other hand, it would be worth paying attention to the fact that the temperature in December changed from the lowest of 56.00 F up to 83.00 F at highest. The standard deviation proves that temperature in Oahu will likely change drastically in December. Temperature of 56 F might keep people away from both surfing and ice cream.

### Additional queries
* Analysis in further detail - The temperature data could be further analyzed by station and year. Currently, analysis has been conducted over multiple years at various locations all together. An analysis by year will provide view of whether the climate is similar year over year without abnormality. Additionally, temperature by station will be helpful when a decision is made regarding the shop location.

* Other relevant data to decision-making - Not only temperature but other weather conditions will affect the surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. People do not want to surf in a rain even if the temperature is high. To the contrary, people would like to go surfing under a chilly weather if the seawater temperature is mild. Precipitation and seawater temperature will be such conditions that would provide insights in depth.
